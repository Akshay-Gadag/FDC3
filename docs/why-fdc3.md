## Why look for FDC3 enabled applications?

You want to for your business to move fast and use best of breed applications.
Application integration has traditionally been a timely and costly exercise, meaning that once a set of applications supporting a workflow was established, changing parts of the workflow without very good reason was a no-go.
The man goal of FDC3 is standardise how applications can communicate, without having defined inter-application workflows prior to being deployed.
Applications that are FDC3 enabled can take part in a workflow on the desktop without any coding or manual integration, allowing you to replace one application with another application serving the same functions to the desktop (in FDC3 terms - supporting the same Intents and Context)

## Why should I FDC3-enable my applications?

The trend is towards breaking up monolithic desktop applications and building effective adaptible wokflows using best-of-breed applications. Still much of the integration on the desktop is done by the actual end-user; copy/paste between applications, exporting/importing csv files etc. Every application that have manual user input is a candidate for being FDC3 enabled, being able to demonstrate that your application can effectively take part in a worklow (without manual dual-entry or other tedious operations)is a quick way to gain more happy customers. Allowing your application to reach out to other applications is another way of extending the power of your application offering; your app might not offer charting, but can let the end-user effectively chart in an FDC3 enabled companion application based on context passed from your application.

## Why should my development team look at adapting FDC3?

Deploying effective end-user workflows with as little development effort as possible, should be the goal for all internal/platform integration development teams. Implementing or developing an a platform that is FDC3 enabled, will if done right, result in more bang for the buck: FDC3 is all about (re)usability and low-touch integration, with an [App directory](appd-intro) in place and a platform to develop on, each new enabled app broadens the value of the workflow offering.
