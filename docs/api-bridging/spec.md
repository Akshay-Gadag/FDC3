# Notes
Need to product some description of a protocol, to be used over a websocket, for exchanging messages about FDC3 calls between Desktop Agents.
## Overall protocol details
* Sender details to be added by websocket server to top level messages AND any embedded AppMetadata objects.
    * AppMetadata needs a new `agent `field
    * When a client connects to a server it should be assigned an identity of some sort, which can be used to augment messages with details of the agent
        * The server should do the assignments and could generate ids or accept them via config.
        * Clients don't need to know their own ids or even the ids of others, they just need to be able to pass around AppMetadata objects that contain them.
* Preserve message path as it passes through different servers?
* GUIDs required to uniquely identify messages
    * To be referenced in replies
* Desktop agents that are bridged will need to wait for responses from other desktop agents before responding to API callsâ€¦
    * for resilience, this may mean defining timeouts
    * Desktop Agents may need GUIDs and / OR metadata - names?


## Generic request and response formats

### Request:
```typescript
{
   requestGuid: string,
   timestamp: date,
   type: string, //FDC3 function name message relates to, e.g. "findIntent"
   intent: string,
   context?: Context,
   sourceAgent?: string  //optional as filled in by server and subsequently used to route responses
}
```

### Response:
Responses will be differentiated by the presence of a `responseGuid` field.
```typescript
{
   requestGuid: string, //value from request
   responseGuid: string,
   timestamp: Date,
   type: string, //same as request value
   intent: string,
   appIntent: AppIntent,
   sourceAgent?: string, //optionalsd filled in by server on receipt of message
   targetAgent: string //sourceAgent from request,  used to route response
}
```
Clients should send these messages on to the 'server', which will add the `sourceAgent` metadata. Further, when processing responses, the agent acting as the 'server' should augment any `AppMetadata` objects in responses with the the same id applied to sourceAgent.




## Individual message exchanges

Assume that we have 3 agents connected by bridge: agent-A, agent-B and agent-C. agent-C provides a websocket server that agent-A and agent-B have connected to.

### For broadcasts on channels
Only needs a single message (no response)
An app on agent-A does:
```javascript
fdc3.broadcast(contextObj);
``` 
or 
```javascript
(await fdc3.getOrCreateChannel("myChannel")).broadcast(contextObj)
```

It encodes this as a message which it sends to the websocker (hosted by agent-C):

```JSON
{
   requestGuid: "some-guid-string-here",
   timestamp: "2020-03-...",
   type: "broadcast",
   channel: "myChannel",
   context: contxtObj
}
```

which it repeats on to Agent-B with the sourceAgent metadata added:
```JSON
{
   requestGuid: "some-guid-string-here",
   timestamp: "2020-03-...",
   type: "broadcast",
   channel: "myChannel",
   context: contxtObj,
   sourceAgent: "agent-A"
}
```


### findIntent
```
findIntent(intent: string, context?: Context): Promise<AppIntent>;
```
#### Request format:

A findIntent call is made on agent-A. It sends an outward message to the other desktop agents (sent from A -> C, which C then sends on to B)):
let appIntent = await fdc3.findIntent();

```
{
   requestGuid: "4dd60b3b-9835-4cab-870c-6b9b099ed7ae",
   timestamp: "2020-03-...",
   type: "findIntent",
   intent: "StartChat"
   context?: contxtObj
}
```

And repeated from C -> B as:
```
{
   requestGuid: "4dd60b3b-9835-4cab-870c-6b9b099ed7ae",
   timestamp: 2020-03-...,
   type: "findIntent",
   intent: "StartChat"
   context?: contxtObj,
   sourceAgent: "agent-A"
}
```

Note that the `sourceAgent` field has been populated with the id of the agent that raised the requests, enabling the routing of responses.

#### Response format

E.g.
Normal response from:agent A,where the request was raised (a websocket client)
```
{
    intent: { name: "StartChat", displayName: "Chat" },
    apps: [
        { name: "myChat" }
    ]
}
```
Desktop agent B (a websocket client) 

```
{
    intent: { name: "StartChat", displayName: "Chat" },
    apps: [
        { name: "Skype" },
        { name: "Symphony" },
        { name: "Symphony", instanceId: "93d2fe3e-a66c-41e1-b80b-246b87120859" },
        { name: "Slack" }
    ]
}
```

which is sent back over the bridge by Agent B -> C as:
```
{
    requestGuid: "4dd60b3b-9835-4cab-870c-6b9b099ed7ae",
    responseGuid: "b4cf1b91-0b64-45b6-9f55-65503d507024"
    timestamp: 2020-03-...,
    type: "findIntent",
    intent: "StartChat",
    agent: undefined // can be undefined for server to fill in
    appIntent: {
        intent: { name: "StartChat", displayName: "Chat" },
        apps: [
            { name: "Skype"},
            { name: "Symphony" },
            { name: "Symphony", instanceId: "93d2fe3e-a66c-41e1-b80b-246b87120859" },
            { name: "Slack" }
        ]
    },
    targetAgent: "agent-A"
}
```

Which gets repeated by the websocket server (agent-C) in augmented form as:
```
{
    requestGuid: "4dd60b3b-9835-4cab-870c-6b9b099ed7ae",
    responseGuid: "b4cf1b91-0b64-45b6-9f55-65503d507024"
    timestamp: 2020-03-...,
    type: "findIntent",
    intent: "StartChat",
    appIntent: {
        intent: { name: "StartChat", displayName: "Chat" },
        apps: [
            { name: "Skype", agent: "agent-B"},
            { name: "Symphony", agent: "agent-B" },
            { name: "Symphony", instanceId: "93d2fe3e-a66c-41e1-b80b-246b87120859", agent: "agent-B" },
            { name: "Slack", agent: "agent-B" }
        ]
    },
    targetAgent: "agent-A"
    sourceAgent: "agent-B"
}


Desktop agent C (the websocket server) as sends its own response:
```
{
    intent: { name: "StartChat", displayName: "Chat" },
    apps: [
       { name "WebIce"}
    ]
}
```

which it encodes as a message:
```
{
    requestGuid: "4dd60b3b-9835-4cab-870c-6b9b099ed7ae",
    responseGuid: "988a49c8-49c2-4fb4-aad4-be39d1471834"
    timestamp: 2020-03-...,
    type: "findIntent",
    intent: "StartChat",
    appIntent: {
        intent: { name: "StartChat", displayName: "Chat" },
        apps: [
           { name "WebIce", agent: "agent-C"}
        ]
     },
     targetAgent: "agent-A"
     sourceAgent: "agent-C"
}
```
Then on agent-A the originating app finally gets back the following response from the FDC3 desktop agent:
```
{
    intent: { name: "StartChat", displayName: "Chat" },
    apps: [
        { name: "myChat" }, // local to this agent
        { name: "Skype", agent: "agent-B" },
        { name: "Symphony", agent: "agent-B" },
        { name: "Symphony", instanceId: "93d2fe3e-a66c-41e1-b80b-246b87120859", agent: "agent-B" },
        { name: "Slack", agent: "agent-B" },
        { name "WebIce", agent: "agent-C"} //this came from another DA
    ]
}
```

### raiseIntent
```
raiseIntent(intent: string, context: Context, app?: TargetApp): Promise<IntentResolution>;
```
Note as IntentResolutions can now return a promise of result data there are multiple response formats required
